# OpenAI Voice-to-Agent Workflow

This document describes the complete voice-driven workflow for creating AI agents through ChatGPT/OpenAI conversations.

## 🎯 **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Voice Conversation in ChatGPT/OpenAI**
1. **Start a conversation** with ChatGPT/OpenAI
2. **Describe your agent idea** in natural language:
   ```
   "I need an AI agent that can send personalized email marketing campaigns. 
   It should connect to our CRM, segment customers, and track open rates."
   ```
3. **Refine the requirements** through conversation
4. **Finalize the PRD** with ChatGPT's help

### **Step 2: Automatic PRD Delivery**
1. **OpenAI MCP Server** extracts the PRD from your conversation
2. **Automatically delivers** it to END_CAP Agent Factory
3. **Creates a Devin AI task** with optimized prompts

### **Step 3: Devin AI Deployment**
1. **Copy the generated prompt** to Devin AI
2. **Devin AI automatically**:
   - Creates GitHub repository
   - Sets up Supabase database
   - Deploys to Google Cloud Run
   - Integrates with your platform

### **Step 4: Agent Integration**
1. **Agent becomes available** in your END_CAP dashboard
2. **Monitor performance** and usage
3. **Iterate and improve** as needed

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Configure OpenAI MCP Server in Devin AI**

1. **Go to Devin AI** → MCP Marketplace
2. **Create new MCP server** with these settings:
   - **Name**: `END_CAP Agent Factory - OpenAI Integration`
   - **Transport**: `STDIO`
   - **Command**: `python3`
   - **Arguments**: `/Users/jason/Repositories/end-cap-agent-factory/scripts/openai-mcp-server.py`

3. **Add secrets**:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `ENDCAP_API_URL`: `http://localhost:8000` (or your END_CAP URL)

### **2. Test the Integration**

```bash
# Test the MCP server
echo '{"method": "get_endcap_status"}' | python3 scripts/openai-mcp-server.py

# Test PRD creation
echo '{"method": "create_prd_from_conversation", "params": {"conversation": "I need an email marketing agent that can send personalized campaigns", "agent_type": "email"}}' | python3 scripts/openai-mcp-server.py
```

1. Answer common questions using a knowledge base
2. Escalate complex issues to human agents
3. Track customer satisfaction scores
4. Integrate with your existing support system

Would you like me to add any specific features like multi-language support or integration with specific tools?"

- Real-time chat interface
- Analytics and reporting dashboard"
```

### **Automatic Delivery:**
1. **MCP Server extracts** the PRD from conversation
2. **Delivers to END_CAP** automatically
3. **Creates Devin AI task** with optimized prompt
4. **Ready for deployment** in minutes
